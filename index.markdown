# Location of Every Photo From the ISS

<span class="pubdate">March 2013</span>

 Since the first mission to the International Space Station over 12 years ago
there have been over a _million_ photographs taken by astronauts looking out
from four hundred kilometers above Earth. Nearly all of them have been
[archived on NASA's servers]("http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/). I've crawled that
archive, pulling down the location for each of the 1,129,177 photographs taken
from the ISS<sup>1</sup>. <span class="footnote"><sup>1</sup>Photos were only
archived if they were found in the database and had a known latitude and
longitude. It's not necessarily every single image ever taken, but it's close.</span>
