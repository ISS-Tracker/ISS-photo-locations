# ISS-photo-locations

A data dump of the location of all photos taken from the International Space Station.

Since the first mission to the International Space Station over 12 years ago there
have been over a million of photographs taken by astronauts from their perch four
hundred kilometers above Earth. Nearly all of them have been archived on NASAâ€™s
servers. I've crawled that archive and pulled out the approximate location of the
ISS when each photo was taken.

## Format

The data exists in a collection of .csv files in the folder `./data/`. There is a
file for each ISS mission, `ISS001.csv`, `ISS002.csv`, etc. in the following format:

    Column   Mission-Roll-Frame | Latitude | Longitude
    Example  ISS001-E-5411, 45.5, -122.6

## Example Use

In python you could read in a file like this:

```python
with open("data/ISS001.csv") as f:
    for line in f:
        columns = line.split(',')
        mrf = columns[0]
        latitude = float(columns[1])
        longitude = float(columns[2])
        print mrf, latitude, longitude
```
